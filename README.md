The project is dedicated to the development of a custom Large Language Model (LLM) tailored for analyzing and interpreting documents uploaded by users. Our custom LLM model understand, summarize, classify, and extract valuable information from a wide range of document types. Whether it's extracting key points from lengthy reports, summarizing articles, or categorizing documents based on their content, our model is designed to streamline the process and provide users with actionable insights based on user queries.
